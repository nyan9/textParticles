# textParticles

### Background
Series of connected nodes are shaped into the text entered by the user. 
Hovering the mouse over the shape will dismantle it momentarily based on specified radius around the cursor.
Nodes will either be connected or disconnected to other nodes based on proximity (proximity graph based nearest neighbor)

### Functionality & MVP
+ brief explination of the app with user instructions
+ text input
+ "text particles" as default, if no input from user
+ mouse hover on text disrupts shape of nodes 
+ Controls to set desired proximity for the connection/disconnection of nodes
